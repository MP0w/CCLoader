CCLoader
========

CCLoader loads custom sections into the iOS 7 Control Center. To create a custom section check out the Control Center NIC template here: https://github.com/JonasGessner/Theos-NIC-Templates
<br>
<br>

Available in Cydia: http://cydia.saurik.com/package/de.j-gessner.ccloader
<br>
<br>

Stock Control Center sections can also be replaced with a custom bundle. The NIC template will ask you for which section ID should be replaced. The Section IDs that can be replaced with CCLoader are:

com.apple.controlcenter.settings<br>
com.apple.controlcenter.brightness<br>
com.apple.controlcenter.media-controls<br>
com.apple.controlcenter.air-stuff<br>
com.apple.controlcenter.quick-launch<br>
<br>
<br>

If a stock section is replaced, the section replacing the original section will automatically be the same size as the original section, therefore the section height specified in the replacing section will be ignored and is irrelevant.
