CCLoader
========

CCLoader loads custom sections into the iOS 7 Control Center. To create a custom section check out the Control Center NIC template here: https://github.com/JonasGessner/Theos-NIC-Templates

Available in Cydia: http://cydia.saurik.com/package/de.j-gessner.ccloader


Stock Control Center sections can also be replaced with a custom bundle. The NIC template will ask you for which section ID should be replaced. The Section IDs that can be replaced with CCLoader are:

com.apple.controlcenter.settings
com.apple.controlcenter.brightness
com.apple.controlcenter.media-controls
com.apple.controlcenter.air-stuff
com.apple.controlcenter.quick-launch
